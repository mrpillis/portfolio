<blockquote>
  <p>
We rebuild the classic “ambient room” interaction system on a smaller scale, set inside a phone booth.

AmbientPhoneBooth was an interactive audio installation that transformed a phone booth into an on-demand spatial audio experience. The system captured auditory memories and recreated spatialized soundscapes with delayed feedback, evoking nostalgia and a sense of temporal presence.
