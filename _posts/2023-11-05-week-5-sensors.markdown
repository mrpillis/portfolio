To preserve autobiographical memory in simulations through immersive systems, this ongoing body of work explores methods for creating interfaces that link tangible objects, 3D scans of real spaces, and virtual artifacts integrated with lived experiences. The goal is to create linkages capable of evoking vivid memory recollection. These systems are designed to facilitate intergenerational memory sharing and have shown potential for enhancing emotional well-being, family and social connectivity, as well as evoking feelings of telepresence and communication across time.
