This ongoing research investigates how immersive systems can preserve autobiographical memory by integrating tangible objects, 3D scans of real environments, and virtual artifacts grounded in lived experience. The project aims to create emotionally resonant linkages that evoke vivid memory recollection.

Designed to support intergenerational memory sharing, these systems show promising potential for enhancing emotional well-being, strengthening familial and social bonds, and fostering a sense of telepresence—enabling communication and connection across time.
