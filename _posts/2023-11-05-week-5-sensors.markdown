To preserve autobiographical memory in simulations through immersive systems, the following ongoing body of work explores various methods for creating interfaces linking tangible objects, 3D scans of real spaces, and virtual artifacts integrated with lived experiences, with the goal of creating linkages capable of evoking vivid memory recollection. These systems are designed to facilitate inter-generational memory sharing, and have demonstrated potential for enhancing emotional well-being, family connectivity and social connectivity, as well as feelings of telepresence and communication across time.
