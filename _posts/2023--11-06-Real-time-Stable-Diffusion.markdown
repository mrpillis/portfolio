  <p>
This project integrates real-time Stable Diffusion into TouchDesigner for dynamic virtual production. Using a high-res LED wall, we explore how generative AI enhances set design, props, and storytelling. Our case studies show how AI streamlines workflows, enabling rapid, cost-effective prototyping and immersive environments for in-camera VFX and filmmaking.
