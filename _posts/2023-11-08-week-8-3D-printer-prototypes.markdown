Recent advances in artificial intelligence through the development of widely available large language models have enabled highly realistic real-time interactions with virtual characters. In a recent research project, titled AI Theatre, we are exploring the potential of multi-agent interactions with users in a conversational user interface, designed to study how interactions with virtual characters can enhance a user’s real life interactions. The AI Theatre simulation is a pedagogical tool merging AI and theater to facilitate practice of interpersonal conflict resolution. Drawing inspiration from Augusto Boal’s concept of theater as a catalyst for societal change, AI Theatre employs virtual agents and large language models to simulate lifelike conflict scenarios. Users engage with these agents, experimenting with various conflict resolution strategies within a secure and safe simulation environment. Results from a study involving 240 participants indicated that AI Theatre significantly enhanced confidence and self-efficacy in devising conflict solutions, showcasing its efficacy in teaching conflict management skills across social and professional contexts. Developing this project with students and faculty peers at Emerson will enable greater insight at the intersection of AI, theatre, and human-AI collaboration.
