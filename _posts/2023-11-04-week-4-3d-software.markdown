  <p>
Our research team at the Tangible Media Group is invested in a vision for the future of Human-Material Interaction, in
which all digital information has a physical manifestation. Humans have evolved a heightened ability to sense and
manipulate the physical world, yet the GUI based on intangible pixels takes little advantage of this capacity. Our vision for tangible media builds upon our natural dexterity by embodying digital information in physical space. By exploring the intersection of contemporary human-computer interaction research with an emphasis on tangible affordances, we are continuing to re-envision the potential future of human-computer relations. Over the past quarter century, through
a series of Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms projects, we have been pursuing Human-Material Interaction (HMI) as a
new model of HCI for the post-pixel era. The aim of this "Body x Materials" workshop resonates with our vision of HMI.
We would like to contribute to the workshop by introducing the three categories of "Body x Materials":
• Human-Material Expression: Creative Environments
• Human-Material Performance: Wearable Responsive Materials
• Human-Material Transcendence: Beyond Life
