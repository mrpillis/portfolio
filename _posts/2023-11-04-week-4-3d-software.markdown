  <p>
At the Tangible Media Group, we explore Human-Material Interaction by making digital information physical. Our work reimagines human-computer interaction beyond screens, using tangible affordances. Through projects like Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms, we pursue a post-pixel future of embodied interaction across expression, performance, and transcendence in “Body x Materials.”
