## Case Studies

### 1️⃣ Please Take Me With You  
A project using 100 miniature "time capsule" boxes distributed across the MIT Media Lab. Community members filled the boxes with mementos from their labs, which were later collected, photographed, and exhibited. The project fostered a sense of closeness by sharing physical objects, creating a symbolic presence across spaces.  
**Project Type:** Object Correspondence / Memory Capsule System

---

### 2️⃣ Media Lab Memory Project  
A miniature museum created using Gaussian splatting to reconstruct the MIT Media Lab in 3D. This interactive environment invited participants to explore the lab as a memory space, blending digital capture and nostalgia.  
**Project Type:** Spatial Memory Simulation / Digital Twin

---

### 3️⃣ Tangible Media Lab Digital Twin  
A digital twin of the Tangible Media Lab space, enabling large-scale simulations and interactive exploration. This project emphasized spatial memory and embodied presence in digital environments.  
**Project Type:** Digital Twin Simulation

---

### 4️⃣ Deloitte Greenhouse Workshop  
A hands-on workshop where participants built 3D models of childhood homes using clay, markers, and everyday materials. These models were scanned into 3D, allowing participants to "walk through" their childhood spaces in VR using projection mapping and Varjo XR headsets.  
**Project Type:** Interactive Memory Workshop / 3D Spatial Memory Reconstruction

---

### 5️⃣ Ancestral Simulations  
A collaborative motion capture project inspired by Black diaspora folklore and ritual dance, developed with Georine Pierre. This immersive performance visualized ancestral storytelling through body movement, exploring how embodied practices can be archived for future generations.  
**Project Type:** Embodied Archive / Motion Capture Performance

---

### 6️⃣ AmbientPhoneBooth  
An interactive audio installation using a phone booth to create on-demand spatial audio experiences. It captured auditory memories, representing users’ movements with delayed spatial soundscapes to evoke nostalgia and presence.  
**Project Type:** Spatial Audio Memory / Soundscape Interface

---

### 7️⃣ Personal Virtual Simulations  
An exploration of personal memory simulations using virtual design techniques. Collaborations with Masanori Nagashima, Phillip Beesely, and IDEO Cambridge produced prototypes that blend personal stories with speculative design to rethink lifelogging and presence.  
**Project Type:** Speculative Design / Virtual Simulation for Memory
