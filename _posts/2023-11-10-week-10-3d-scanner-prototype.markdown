The final project of this independent study is culminating in a custom 3D scanner. This will be finished on at the end of the semester. I soent about a week troubleshooting the XIAO ESP32 Sense before I finally undersood how to make them work. They need to be booted each time they are loaded, and after the script is run, they then need to be reset. The buttons are so small it is hard to see what to do. Once I figured out this workflow, it was much easier. I can now get a webserver running and had all 6 of the cameras working. The next issue is getting them to work at once. Quentin advised me to adjust the code so that the header is changed which will allow me to control the input of the camera.
