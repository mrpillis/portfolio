As part of the Andy Warhol Museum’s “Exposures” series, I created Andy Warhola’s Living Room—a digitally fabricated 3D recreation of Warhol’s childhood home, inspired by his pastel drawing “Living Room.” The installation reimagined Warhol’s memory through archival photos, family input, and digital sculptural techniques.
