<blockquote> <p>This project presents a full-body 3D scan of a subject posed within a partially demolished interior space. Captured using photogrammetry and volumetric reconstruction, the subject appears suspended in time with arms extended, evoking both vulnerability and presence. This scan forms part of a broader exploration into embodied presence, memory, and spatial storytelling for use in mixed reality installations, virtual heritage archives, and generative AI environments.
