An online simulation using OpenAI API designed to study human-AI interaction using computer animated visualizations of humanoid characters, Large language models trigger motion captured three-dimensional characters based on user input.

Despite significant historical progress, discrimination and social stigma continue to impact the lives of LGBTQIA+ individuals. The use of AI-generated virtual characters offers a unique opportunity to facilitate advocacy by engaging individuals in simulated conversations that can foster understanding, education, and empathy. This paper explores the potential of AI simulations to help individuals practice LGBTQIA+ advocacy, while also acknowledging the need for ethical considerations and addressing concerns about oversimplification or perpetuation of stereotypes. By combining technological innovation with a commitment to inclusivity, we aim to contribute to the ongoing struggle for equality in both the legal framework and the hearts and minds of the community. We present a study evaluating virtual characters driven by generative conversational AI simulating the social interactions surrounding “coming out of the closet,” a rite of passage associated with LGBTQIA+ communities. In our study, virtual characters embodied as queer individuals engage with users in a text-based conversation simulation paired with visual representations. We investigate how the interactions between the virtual characters and a user influence the user’s comfort, confidence, empathy, and sympathy. The AI simulation includes distinct visual personas deployed in a series of conditions. We present findings from our deployments involving 307 users. Finally, we discuss the design implications of our work on the potential future of embodied, self-actuated, and openly LGBTQIA+ intelligent agents.
