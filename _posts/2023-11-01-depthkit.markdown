<blockquote> <p>A series of explorations using Depthkit and volumetric capture techniques produced a dataset focused on reconstructing embodied presence within architecturally complex spaces. Using these techniques, we generated scenes that are stereo-compatible and suitable for real-time rendering in VR headsets.
The result is a collection of volumetric clips and environmental scans that challenge the boundary between documentary realism and spatial abstraction.
