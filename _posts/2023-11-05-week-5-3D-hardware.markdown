**Real-time Stable Diffusion for Virtual Production: Room Scale Generative AI towards the Ultimate Display**  
Daniel Pillis, Phillip Cerner, Martin Sawtell  
*Emerson College / MIT — Dell EMC — Generative AI for Design Workshop (2025), Extended Abstract*
<blockquote>
  <p>
Using real time Stable Diffusion, a Touch Designer system enables real time prompting to dynamically change objects, environments, and actors in an immersive state of the art virtual production environment 

This project integrates real-time diffusion models into virtual production, enhancing in-camera VFX and set design through generative AI. By streamlining environment creation and prototyping, it reduces costs and improves efficiency. Our case studies show how AI-driven workflows can transform filmmaking, enabling adaptive, performance-based design in immersive storytelling environments.
