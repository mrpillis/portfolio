<blockquote>
  <p>
Using real time Stable Diffusion, a Touch Designer system enables real time prompting to dynamically change objects, environments, and actors in an immersive state of the art virtual production environment 

Our project demonstrates the integration of real-time diffusion models into virtual production workflows, highlighting the transformative performance benefits of generative AI when applied to in-camera VFX for filmmaking. Through a series of case studies using a 2240 × 1440 1.9mm pixel virtual production display, we are exploring the performance benefits of real-time stable diffusion as a way to generate immersive virtual environments, showcasing how generative AI enhances artificial set design, prop creation, and rapid prototyping for storytelling. Generative design in virtual production mirrors advancements in other fields, such as architecture and UI/UX design, where parametric and generative models have revolutionized traditional workflows by enabling iterative and adaptive design approaches. Innovations in generative AI for virtual production enable better resource allocation, reduced costs, and efficient prototyping and visualization, significantly streamlining the filmmaking process. The use of diffusion models will enable filmmakers to shift from manually intensive design processes to AI-assisted creative workflows, facilitating the development of virtual production environments that enhance storytelling. This in-progress case study contributes to the growing discourse surrounding AI-enhanced performance-based design by demonstrating the applicability of real-time generative AI to creative workflows in an active virtual production studio environment. Our in-progress results demonstrate the promising potential of these technologies to transform virtual production.
